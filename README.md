🪨 Rock Paper Scissors - Python Game 🎮
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python. It allows a player to play against the computer using basic user input, conditional logic, and randomization.

🚀 Features
Takes user input (rock, paper, or scissors)
Computer randomly picks one option
Compares both and declares:
✅ Win
❌ Loss
🤝 Tie
Displays results clearly

📌 Concepts Used
Python input() function
random.choice() for computer move
if-elif-else conditional logic
String formatting (f"")
Basic function usage

📷 Sample Output

Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): rock
You chose rock and computer chose scissors
Rock smashes scissors! Player wins.

🎯 Purpose
This project was created as a part of my Python learning journey. It's a simple terminal-based game to practice:

Conditionals
Functions
User interaction
I plan to expand it later with score tracking, a loop, or even a GUI version using Tkinter or Flask.

🧠 How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. Then:
python rpsgame.py
